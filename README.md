Build instructions
==================

This project uses [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) in order to serialize messages. It should be available in most repositories (in Debian/Ubuntu as **libprotobuf-java**) or at https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/.

In order to build type `ant build` or `ant jar` for a runnable jar file.

The path to protobuf.jar may have to be modified in build.xml.

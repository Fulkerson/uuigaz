{"name":"Uuigaz.","body":"uuigaz.\r\n======\r\n\r\nuuigaz is a turn based game inspired by the guessing game of battleships. It is implemented in Java and Python using [Protocol Buffers](http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/) as a cross platform way of serializing protocol data into a compact and extensible format.\r\n\r\nRules\r\n-----\r\nThe game is played by two players, each trying to sink the enemy ships by guessing what position to fire at.\r\nShips are laid out on a grid in secret by each player prior to a game and the first one to sink all enemy ships wins.\r\nIn this variant of the game the following ship types and sizes are used:\r\n\r\n1. Submarine\r\n2. Destroyer\r\n3. Cruiser\r\n4. Battleship\r\n5. Carrier\r\n\r\nShips cannot share location and cannot be placed in a tile adjacent to another ship.\r\n\r\nClient\r\n------\r\nThe following screenshots display the different parts of the main client:\r\n* login screen\r\n* placement screen\r\n* game board\r\n\r\n### Login screen\r\n![login](https://github.com/Fulkerson/uuigaz/raw/gh-pages/images/login.png)\r\nUpon start each player is presented a login screen which can be used to choose which session to use, although no real authentication is done besides name.\r\n\r\n### Placement screen\r\n![placement](https://github.com/Fulkerson/uuigaz/raw/gh-pages/images/placement.png)\r\nOn the placement screen ships are placed onto the board by clicking a grid and the keyboard arrow keys can be used to select orientation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Game board\r\n![board](https://github.com/Fulkerson/uuigaz/raw/gh-pages/images/board.png)\r\nDuring the actual game phase the players own board are displayed on the top left and the opponent board down to the right. Misses are indicated by the teal color and hits as black. A sunken enemy ship is indicated by a log message as well as a morse SOS signal.\r\n\r\n### Test Client\r\n![testai](https://github.com/Fulkerson/uuigaz/raw/gh-pages/images/testai.png)\r\nThere is also a text based test client written in Java that may double as a very stupid AI opponent. The test client will display boards and actions as unicode characters. In the above screenshot two test clients battle each other off, both randomly making moves until there is one winner.\r\n\r\nServer and protocol\r\n-------------------\r\nThe server is written in Java and will upon broken connections remember the session. This means it is possible to make a move and quit the game while waiting for opponent to make his move. Communication with the server is done through messages that are serialized into the more or less standardized binary wire format which are then sent in a delimited form over TCP.\r\n\r\nThe messages are defined using an interface description language and are then compiled down to the language of choice, namely Python and Java in this project.\r\nLanguages supported by the official compiler are:\r\n* C++\r\n* Python\r\n* Java\r\n\r\nbut there exist implementations for many other languages as well. A message could be defined as follows:\r\n```protobuf\r\nmessage Ident {\r\n    required string name = 1;\r\n    optional bool secure = 2;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand would compiled to Java result in a class with methods such as `.getName()`, `.setName(String)`,  `.hasSecure()` and `.getSecure()`\r\n\r\nThis has proven to be a very powerful and flexible concept that allow for large modifications even in late development without needing to rethink and reimplement a whole binary protocol. Implementing the protocol in different languages also becomes much easier as it is only the matter of executing a compiler. It is also quite efficient, for example the above definition would result in secure not being transferred at all unless explicitly set by the sender. \r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThe name of the project, uuigaz, comes from runic inscriptions and seem to be old norse for 'warrior'.
